# Advent of Code 2016

## Intro

Santa's sleigh uses a very high-precision clock to guide its movements, 
and the clock's oscillator is regulated by stars. Unfortunately, the 
stars have been stolen... by the Easter Bunny. To save Christmas, Santa 
needs you to retrieve all fifty stars by December 25th.
